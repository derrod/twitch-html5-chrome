Chrome Extension to replace default player with the unreleased but functional HTML5 player.

If you don't want to fiddle around with extensions in developer mode you can use this userscript: https://gist.github.com/derrod/518da2f42eeccc4e8315 (Works with Firefox and Greasemonkey too!)

A fair warning:
* I'm not experienced with Javascript. There are probably better ways to do this
* It doesn't work if you just navigate to some page, a hard reload ist required (unfortunately)
* There might be bugs or w/e.
* Again, it's probably shitty code
